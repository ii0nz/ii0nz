I have both lines of code in the other txt document but this is just an explanation of how to use this very cool and interesting
command. First click on the top cmd prompt shortcut and wait a couple of seconds until windows 32 pops up on the top left as user.
Now exit command prompt and click on the second shortcut and there should be a couple sentances explaining. Then wait for the show
to start and Enjoy!!!
